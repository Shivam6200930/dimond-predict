## Overview

Diamond price prediction is an important aspect of the jewelry industry, helping appraisers and buyers make informed decisions. By analyzing various features of a diamond, such as its carat weight and cut quality, we can build a model to predict its market price accurately.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

- **Carat**: The weight of the diamond.
- **Cut**: The quality of the diamond cut (e.g., Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
- **Color**: The color grading of the diamond (from J, the worst, to D, the best).
- **Clarity**: The clarity grading of the diamond (from I3, the worst, to FL, the best).
- **Depth**: The total depth percentage (z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y)).
- **Table**: The width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point.
- **Price**: The price of the diamond in US dollars.
- **X, Y, Z**: The dimensions of the diamond (in mm).

The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle's Diamonds Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds).

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diamond-price-prediction.git
   cd diamond-price-prediction

2. Set up a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate.  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```


3.Install the required packages:
```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 ## Usage

 To use the model for prediction:

1.Preprocess the dataset using the provided Jupyter notebooks.
2.Train the model using the training script.
3.Evaluate the model on the test dataset.
 

 ## Models
 This project explores various machine learning models for predicting diamond prices, including:

  1.Linear Regression.
  2.Decision Trees.
  3.Random Forest.
  4.Gradient Boosting.
  5.Neural Networks.

  ## Results
   The models are evaluated using metrics such as:

   1.Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
   2.Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   3.R-squared Score (RÂ²).
